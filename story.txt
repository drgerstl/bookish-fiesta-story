Once upon a time, there was a little girl who lived in a village near the
forest. Whenever she went out, the little girl wore a red riding cloak, so
everyone in the village called her Little Red Riding Hood. There was also a really 
mean big bad wolf named Tim. Tim didn't like the color red so he really didn't like
little red riding hood. Tim was somewhat known as a bully in school. One day during
recess Tim saw that Red was having fun, and Tim did not like to see that.So Tim went
up to Red and asked her why she wears the same clothes every day.
