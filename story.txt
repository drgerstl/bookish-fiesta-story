Once upon a time, there was a little girl who lived in a village near the
forest. Whenever she went out, the little girl wore a red riding cloak, so
everyone in the village called her Little Red Riding Hood. There was also a really 
mean big bad wolf named Tim. Tim didn't like the color red so he really didn't like
little red riding hood.
